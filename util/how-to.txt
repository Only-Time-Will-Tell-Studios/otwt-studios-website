TO ADD A NEW GAME:

For the homepage hero, add another <a class="game-panel"><a>.
Then, add the game's entry into data.json (ensure for the game's id, it is all lowercase and snake_case)
Then, make a folder named "game_name" for it, and under that folder make an index.html file.
Link the root path of that folder (/game_name/) to the data.json and hero accordion



TO ADD SUPPORT FOR A NEW LANGUAGE:

In every .html page, add the new language's entry into the nav.settings.lang-select <option> list. 
Use the language's ISO 639-1 two-character ID as the <option>'s value. (ex. en, fr, de, jp, etc.)
Then, add that language and all of its translations into data.json. Ensure you use the same
2 character ID and all the same content keys as the other translations.
